# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-PyTorch

Command to run the python file: python mnist.py

This model has only 2 linear layers. To improve accuaracy, try using convolutional layers, experiment with learning rate and other hyperparameters.
Torchvision already has MNIST dataset, but it can also be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
